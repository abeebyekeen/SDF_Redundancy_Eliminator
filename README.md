# SDF_Redundancy_Eliminator
 A python code to: 1. Generate canonical SMILES for each of the compounds in an SD/SDF compound library, 2. Detect redundant ligands/structural isomers in the library,  3. Generate unique and redundant name lists and, optionally,  4. Move redundant ligands/structural isomers to a separate file to produce a library of unique compounds
